Udacity project submissions for the Fundamentals of Web Development Nanodegree

All four of my projects given to me by the Fundamentals of Front End Development Nanodegree.

I am still a greenhorn when it comes to this stuff. Whenever I followed the rubric or not, I would still love to hear any and all opinions for improvement in the future.

Thank you very much!
